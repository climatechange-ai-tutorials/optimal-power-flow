# AI for Optimal Power Flow
AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) attempts to determine the setpoints of generators that would minimize the operating cost of a power system while meeting other operational constraints. In this tutorial, learn how to leverage PyTorch to train a neural network to approximate the optimal solutions.
